# Grocery List App

This is a small project I created to practice using the Tailwind CSS library. The goal was to get hands-on experience with Tailwind's utility-first approach to styling and to explore its features for building responsive and clean UIs.

## Project Overview

The **Grocery List App** allows users to:

- Add items to a grocery list
- Mark items as purchased
- Remove items from the list

This project helped me become more comfortable with Tailwind's classes and demonstrated how Tailwind can speed up the styling process while maintaining a consistent design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **JavaScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
